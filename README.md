# Linux

A collection of Linux-related resources, including configuration files, scripts, notes, and small experiments.  
This repository is intended as both a personal knowledge base and a practical toolbox for working with Linux systems.

## About the Project

This repository serves as a central place for Linux experiments, exercises, and utilities.  
Typical use cases include:

- Practicing Linux commands and shell scripting.
- Storing useful snippets and configuration examples.
- Testing and documenting behaviors of different tools and utilities.
- Building a reference for day-to-day Linux administration tasks.

If you are learning Linux or just want a reference for common tasks, you can clone this repo and adapt the scripts/configs to your own environment.
